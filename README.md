# CryoSim
## Introduction
CryoSim is a model of a generic cylindrical 4-K cryostat cooled with a commercial PTC, extensively parametrised and setup to conduct a joint mechanical and thermal analysis via finite element methods.  
Such test cryostat can be used to characterise optical components and full reimaging optical systems dedicated to CMB observations.
