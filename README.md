# CryoSim
## Introduction
CryoSim is a model of a generic cylindrical 4-K cryostat cooled with a commercial PTC. Such system can be used to characterise optical components and full reimaging optical systems dedicated to CMB observations. CryoSim is extensively parametrised, allowing the joint analysis and optimisation of mechanical and thermal performance via finite element methods. //
